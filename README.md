# ccscal-plusplus
A program for extracting drift times from ion mobility-mass spec data and obtaining calibrated CCS 

	>>>CcsCal.py<<<

In this project I will be systematically replacing the modules in CcsCal.py with C++ until eventually
the entirety (or most of) the program is written in C++. This will maybe enhance speed a bit but more
importantly it will provide me an opportunity to learn C++.
